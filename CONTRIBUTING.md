# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Code Style

This repository uses [`standard`][standard-url] to maintain code style and consistency,
and to avoid style arguments. `npm test` runs `standard` automatically, so you don't have
to!

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Contributor Guide

You may follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork the official repository.** This will create a copy of the official repository in your own account.
2. **Sync the branches.** This will ensure that your copy of the repository is up-to-date with the latest changes from the official repository.
3. **Work on your forked repository's feature branch.** This is where you will make your changes to the code.
4. **Commit your updates on your forked repository's feature branch.** This will save your changes to your copy of the repository.
5. **Submit a pull request to the official repository's main branch.** This will request that your changes be merged into the official repository.
6. **Resolve any linting errors.** This will ensure that your changes are formatted correctly.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind during the process:

- **Test your changes.** Before you submit a pull request, make sure that your changes work as expected.
- **Be patient.** It may take some time for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.
