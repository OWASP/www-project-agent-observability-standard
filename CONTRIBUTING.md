# Contributing to AOS

We're building trustworthy AI agents together. Your contributions make the future of agent observability possible.

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Search existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicating efforts.

## How to Contribute

**Ideas**: Join issue discussions or start new ones. Your voice shapes AOS direction.

**Writing**: Expand documentation with your expertise. Clear explanations help everyone.

**Copy Editing**: Fix typos, clarify language, improve quality. Every word matters. Follow our [styling guide](./STYLE.md).

**Code**: Implement specifications, build tools, create examples.

**Standards**: Help Improve AOS, extend CycloneDX, SPDX, SWID for agent components.

## Development Process

1. **Fork the repository** - Create your own copy
2. **Sync branches** - Keep up-to-date with latest changes  
3. **Create feature branch** - Work in isolation
4. **Make your changes** - Implement improvements
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure everything works
6. **Submit pull request** - Request merge to `dev` branch
7. **Address feedback** - Collaborate on refinements

## Code Standards

We use [`standard`][standard-url] for consistent code style. Run `npm test` to check automatically.
