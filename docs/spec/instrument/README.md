# Agent Observability Standard - Instrument

AI agents make critical decisions autonomously. They collaborate, execute code, and access sensitive data. But they operate as black boxes. Enterprises can't trust what they can't see.

AOS introduces a standard way to introduce middleware into agent systems to steer its behavior. It transforms opaque agents into transparent, controllable systems.

## What AOS Instrumentation Delivers

**Real-time Control**: Guardian Agents intercept every agent action. Apply enterprise policies. Block data leaks. Enforce compliance before actions execute.

**Complete Transparency**: Stream every decision, tool call, and reasoning step to observability systems. Full audit trail across multi-agent workflows.

**Strongly Integrated**: Works with existing protocols (MCP, A2A). Native support for popular AI agent development frameworks.

## How It Works

AOS is a standard for surfacing every decision, action, prompt, and output as structured events while simultaneously providing hooks for in-line intervention and control.
It create a standard way to insert middleware into agent execution.
Embedding lightweight call-outs at each step of an agentâ€™s reasoning and action cycle.
AOS streams context-rich events to observability back-ends, and allows guardian agents to allow, veto or modify behavior.
