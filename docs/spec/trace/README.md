# AI Agents and Observability
Modern AI agents, by design, operate with a degree of autonomy and complexity that makes their internal logic and decision-making difficult to inspect. 
As these agents orchestrate reasoning, planning, and tool use to achieve their goals, understanding not just _what_ they did, but _why_ and _how_, becomes essential for trust, compliance, and operational excellence. 

**Observability**, rooted in robust tracing and monitoring, transforms agents from black boxes into transparent, governable systems.

To achieve this, we extend the Agent Security & Observability Protocol (ASOP) with a comprehensive observability layer, built on industry-standard telemetry protocols like OpenTelemetry and OCSF. 
This approach ensures that every significant agent action is not only recorded, but contextualized and correlated across distributed systems and multi-agent workflows.

## Observability Objectives

- **Transparency**: Observability enables a clear, step-by-step reconstruction of agent behavior, including the reasoning behind each action. This is fundamental for incident response, compliance traces, and continuous improvement.
    
- **Security and Risk Management**: By tracing agent actions down to atomic operations, organizations can detect anomalous or unauthorized behavior, investigate root causes, and enforce policy controls in real time.
    
- **Performance and Optimization**: Detailed metrics and traces reveal bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and error patterns in agent workflows, supporting targeted tuning and resource management.
    
- **Trust and Accountability**: A verifiable trace trail is the foundation for building trust with stakeholders, regulators, and end users, ensuring that agent-driven decisions can always be justified and explained.
