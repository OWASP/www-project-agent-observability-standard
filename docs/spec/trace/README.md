# Agent Observability Standard - Trace

AI agents make autonomous decisions that impact business outcomes. Without observability, enterprises can't understand, trust, or control these decisions.

**Transform agent black boxes into transparent, auditable systems through comprehensive tracing.**

!!! info "AOS Extends Industry Standards"
    We already have great observability standards, so AOS doesn't introduce a new one. Instead, it extends existing industry-proven standards: OpenTelemetry and OCSF to support AI agent-specific components.

## Why Agent Observability Matters

Modern agents orchestrate complex workflows: reasoning chains, tool execution, knowledge retrieval, multi-agent collaboration. When things go wrong, or right, you need to understand exactly what happened.

**The Problem**: Agents operate autonomously with complex internal logic. Traditional monitoring can't capture reasoning processes or decision context.

**The Solution**: Comprehensive observability that traces every agent action from trigger to outcome, with full reasoning context.

## Observability Goals

**Transparency**: Complete reconstruction of agent behavior. See not just what agents did, but why they made each decision.

**Security**: Detect anomalous behavior in real-time. Trace attack vectors across multi-agent systems. Enforce policies at decision points.

**Performance**: Identify bottlenecks in reasoning chains. Optimize tool usage patterns. Monitor resource consumption across agent workflows.

**Trust**: Verifiable audit trails for regulatory compliance. Explainable decisions for stakeholder confidence.

## How It Works

AOS provides specification for detailed tracing of agent behavior. Traces are implemented via extensions of proven industry standards:

| Standard | AgBOM spec | Status |
|--|--|--|
| [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) | [AOS with OpenTelemetry](./extend_opentelemetry.md) | Working draft |
| [OCSF](https://ocsf.io/) | [AOS with OCSF](./extend_ocsf.md) | Working draft |
