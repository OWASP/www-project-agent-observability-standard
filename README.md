**Holistic framework for Agent Security and Observability making trustworthy Agents achievable.**

## Rational
Agents must become trustworthy to enable widescale adoption.

Transparency is the foundation of trust. Whether built in-house or adopted as part of a service. Consumed on cloud, as SaaS, on-prem or on endpoints. Agents must be fully observable by the enterprise that welcomes them in. We cannot trust a magic black-box.

For agents to become trustworthy they must be **inspectable, auditable and instrumentable**.

- **Inspectable:** we don‚Äôt have to guess what‚Äôs inside. Which tools, models and capabilities are being used. What software version is running and who built it. What are the services behind them, and which data they can access. Must dynamicly adapt to account for rapid changes in agent components.
- **Auditable:** we know what the agent did and why. We can trace back any action taken to the reasoning behind it and the originating task. Even if the thread goes through multiple agents and software systems. In case of compromise, we can identify and remediate the root cause.
- **Instrumentable:** we can hook into agent execution and steer it in the right direction. We can put hard controls around agents and define their scope of action. Apply centralized enterprise logic, be it security, compliance or legal, uniformly across agent platforms. Prevent or modify behavior to comply.

### Key Components

The framework covers the following aspects
1. Agent Security & Observability Protocol (ASOP) that defines the interaction between the Observed Agent and the Guardian Agent
2. Observability requirements and implementations for tracing all ASOP events using OpenTelemetry and OCSF
3. Agent BOM (AgBOM) requirements and implementations for exposing dynamic Agent's bill-of-material via CoycloneDX, SWID and SPDX
