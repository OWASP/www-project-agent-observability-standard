# This workflow builds a MkDocs site and deploys it to GitHub Pages with versioning support using mike.
# It uses the `uv` tool to run MkDocs, which is a modern Python package manager.
# The workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch and can also be run manually.
# It reads the version from the VERSION file and uses it for documentation versioning.
